# Takkar

> A simple one-person ball-dodging game

Takkar is a game with an easy objective - just avoid the gray balls. It gets
more and more difficult as more balls are added and their speed increases.

The game is implemented completely in JavaScript and JQuery, from visuals to
game mechanics (excluding the mouse and hand icons used for the instructions).
There's some interesting math in there for collisions and direction computation.

The name "Takkar" is the anglicized form of the Hindi word टक्कर, which means
"collision" or "crash".
